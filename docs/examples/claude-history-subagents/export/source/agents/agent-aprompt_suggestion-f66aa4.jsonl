Created a PR to trigger CI\n3. Fixed branch protection settings\n4. Tried to test the HTML export\n5.

They want the export to work for release.\n\nBest suggestion: \"yes, investigate and fix it\" or \"investigate the bug\" or \"deploy agent to investigate and fix\"\n\nActually, looking at their recent pattern - they're direct and action-oriented.
