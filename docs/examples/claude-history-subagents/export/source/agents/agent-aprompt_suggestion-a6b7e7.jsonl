But since the agent is running in background and I said I'd notify them, they might:\n1. Wait (no message needed)\n2. Check progress themselves\n3. Ask to clean up the old worktrees while waiting\n\nLooking at the previous pattern - they've been doing things like \"go\", \"deploy background agents for next sprint\", \"pr27 complete, merge issues...\"\n\nSince the dev agent is running, the user might want to do something productive while waiting. Earlier I mentioned 5 worktrees that need cleanup. That would be a natural thing to do while waiting.\n\nOr they might just wait for the notification. In that case, silence would be appropriate.\n\nActually, given the pattern of the conversation, the user seems to like keeping things moving. They might want to clean up the old worktrees while the dev agent runs. But that's me suggesting what I think they should do, not what they would naturally type.\n\nThey might also just wait. Or check progress.\n\nI think the most likely thing is they'd either:\n1. Wait (silence)\n2. Ask about worktree cleanup since I mentioned it earlier\n\nGiven they asked to run Sprint 10i right after I mentioned worktree cleanup as an option, they might now want to do the cleanup while waiting. But I'm not certain.\n\nLet me stay silent since the next step isn't obvious - they might just be waiting for the agent to complete.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":73212,"cache_read_input_tokens":16585,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":73212,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkH5v9KoJwMBBU63zC1c","type":"assistant","uuid":"50f28fee-f697-46e7-a08c-8b5a4dc96a7d","timestamp":"2026-02-03T01:36:25.974Z"}
