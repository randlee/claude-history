Looking at the session summary, the obvious next steps are:\n1. Clean up the worktrees (mentioned as \"to be cleaned up\")\n2.

The most natural next step would be either to clean up the worktrees or to continue to Wave 3.\n\nGiven the user's style of brief commands like \"go\" and \"pr completed, update project-plan with progress this session\", they'd likely want to clean up the worktrees before moving on, or they might want to continue to Wave 3.\n\nThe worktrees cleanup is the most immediate follow-up since it was explicitly noted in the summary.
