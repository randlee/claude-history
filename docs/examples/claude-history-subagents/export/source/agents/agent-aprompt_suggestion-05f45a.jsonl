User has been running a series of sprints for Phase 10\n2. They asked for Sprint 10i with a background agent on a dedicated worktree\n3. Dev agent completed successfully\n4. QA agent is now running\n\nThe user is waiting for the QA agent to complete. They've been following a pattern of:\n- Dev agent runs\n- QA agent runs\n- If QA passes, PR is created\n- After PR merges, move to next step\n\nSince we're waiting for the QA agent, there's nothing obvious for the user to type right now. They're likely just waiting. Once QA completes, the natural next step would be to create a PR.\n\nI should stay silent since we're in a waiting state and the next action depends on the QA results.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":33032,"cache_read_input_tokens":19737,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":33032,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkHYxSzNoUjFvPPqhJhj","type":"assistant","uuid":"d42e811f-0b14-4c02-89b8-55c31d05256d","timestamp":"2026-02-03T01:42:26.309Z"}
