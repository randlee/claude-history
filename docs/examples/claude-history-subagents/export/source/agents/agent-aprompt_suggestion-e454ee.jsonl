I offered them a choice: \"Do you want to clean these up as well, or keep them for reference?\"\n\nLooking at the conversation:\n1. User started with \"verify all pr completed and merged into develop. after verification /sc-git-worktree --cleanup\"\n2. I cleaned up Phase 10 worktrees\n3. User questioned if branches still existed remotely and if tracking was updated\n4. I verified and updated everything\n5. User said \"I still see a lot of branches remotely\"\n6. I clarified Phase 10 branches are deleted, older phases remain\n7. Now asking what other worktrees are tracked\n\nThe user's pattern shows they're being thorough about cleanup. They questioned whether things were actually cleaned up. They're likely going to want to clean up ALL the old worktrees too, not just Phase 10.\n\nThey probably want to say something like \"clean up all of them\" or \"clean up the rest\" or just \"cleanup all\".\n\nMost likely: \"cleanup all\" or \"clean up all the worktrees\" or similar directive.\n\nLet me think about their style - they've been direct and command-oriented: \"go\", \"deploy background agents for next sprint\", \"verify all pr completed and merged\", \"did you actually run the skill\"\n\nSo they'd probably say something direct like:\n- \"cleanup all\"\n- \"clean them up too\"\n- \"cleanup all worktrees\"\n- \"remove all old worktrees\"\n\nI think \"cleanup all\" or \"clean up all the old worktrees\" is most likely given their direct style.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1583,"cache_read_input_tokens":123831,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1583,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkLuZhwbfh7cZrmfxqor","type":"assistant","uuid":"ff66fb2d-7712-4e5b-8016-566b4af9a74f","timestamp":"2026-02-03T02:26:26.234Z"}
