Currently:\n- Sprint 10b: Ready for PR\n- Sprint 10d: QA in progress (still running)\n- Sprint 10g: Ready for PR\n\nThe user's original instructions were to execute the Wave 2 workflow, which includes creating PRs after QA approval. The system is waiting for Sprint 10d QA to complete.\n\nThe user didn't say anything - they just received an update that Sprint 10g is ready for PR and we're waiting for Sprint 10d QA.\n\nThe most natural thing is to let the process continue. The user might want to:\n1. Wait for Sprint 10d QA to complete (which is happening automatically)\n2. Start creating PRs for the two ready sprints\n\nGiven that the user said \"go\" at the start and has been letting the automation run, they're probably fine waiting. But they might want to start creating PRs for the ready sprints while waiting.\n\nActually, the user hasn't typed anything - this is a system update notification. The most natural response is probably silence, or if they want to move things along, they might say something like \"create PRs for the ready ones\" or just wait.\n\nI think silence is appropriate here since we're mid-workflow and the next step is for Sprint 10d QA to complete. The user would naturally just wait.\n\nActually, looking at this again - the user might want to start creating PRs for the two sprints that are ready while waiting for the third. That would be a reasonable thing to type.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2549,"cache_read_input_tokens":72451,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2549,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXk99HS9UTybnkAyyFu6j","type":"assistant","uuid":"a6e1059c-d84a-4ca1-8a3f-16b6411825ad","timestamp":"2026-02-02T23:52:13.763Z"}
