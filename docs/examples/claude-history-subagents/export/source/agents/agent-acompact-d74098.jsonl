In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n<example>\n<analysis>\n[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

They wanted me to:\n1. Read CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md\n2. Output context restoration (Project Overview, Current Status, Wave 1 Summary, Wave 2 Plan)\n3. Execute Phase 10 Wave 2 sprints using a mandatory workflow\n\n### Wave 2 Execution\nUser said \"go\" to begin Wave 2 execution.\n\nI created 3 worktrees in parallel:\n- feature/phase10-chat-layout (Sprint 10b)\n- feature/phase10-overlays (Sprint 10d)\n- feature/phase10-controls (Sprint 10g)\n\nThen deployed 3 background dev agents in parallel for:\n- Sprint 10b: Chat Bubble Layout\n- Sprint 10d: Color-Coded Overlays\n- Sprint 10g: Interactive Controls\n\nAfter each dev agent completed, I deployed QA agents:\n- Sprint 10g QA completed first (PASS)\n- Sprint 10b QA completed (CONDITIONAL PASS - needed commit)\n- Sprint 10d QA completed (PASS)\n\nI committed all changes and created PRs:\n- PR #24: Sprint 10b - Chat Bubble Layout\n- PR #25: Sprint 10d - Color-Coded Overlays\n- PR #26: Sprint 10g - Interactive Controls\n\nUser confirmed \"pr completed\" and I updated PROJECT_PLAN.md with Wave 2 completion status.\n\n### Wave 3 Execution\nUser said \"deploy background agents for next sprint\"\n\nI created 2 worktrees:\n- feature/phase10-navigation (Sprint 10f)\n- feature/phase10-chrome (Sprint 10h)\n\nDeployed 2 background dev agents:\n- Sprint 10f: Deep Dive Navigation\n\n\n- Sprint 10h: Header/Footer Metadata\n\nBoth dev agents finished, then QA agents ran and passed. I committed changes and created PR #27 for navigation and PR #28 for header/footer metadata.\n\n### Merge Conflict Resolution\nUser said: \"pr27 complete, merge issues w/ pr28, background agent to merge develop into pr28 branch, verify tests and lint pass, commit/push.\"\n\nI deployed a background agent to merge develop into feature/phase10-chrome, resolve conflicts in html.go and style.css, run tests and lint checks, then commit and push the changes.\n\n### PROJECT_PLAN.md Update\nUser said: \"update project-plan with progress this session. output next steps\"\n\nI updated PROJECT_PLAN.md to version 2.10, changed status to \"Phase 10 Wave 3 in progress\", added Wave 3 progress summary, marked Sprint 10f as COMPLETE, and was updating the Sprint 10h section when the summary was requested.\n\n### Key Files Modified\nPROJECT_PLAN.md received multiple updates for Wave 2 and Wave 3 completion status. Various files across worktrees for Sprints 10b, 10d, 10g, 10f, and 10h were modified.\n\n### Errors/Issues\nSprint 10b Q found uncommitted changes which I fixed by committing. Git push rejected PROJECT_PLAN.md updates—resolved with pull --rebase. PR #28 had merge conflicts that the deploy agent resolved.\n\n### PRs Created/Merged\nPR #24 through #27 (Sprints 10b, 10d, 10g, 10f) are merged. PR #28 for Sprint 10h is open with conflicts now resolved.\n\n### Pending Tasks\nNeed to finish the Sprint 10h section in PROJECT_PLAN.md, commit and push those updates, then move to Sprint 10i for integration and polish work. Multiple worktrees require cleanup afterward.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":152145,"cache_read_input_tokens":16656,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":152145,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkBsCRRR5SKRrcpNpvgv","type":"assistant","uuid":"9459e839-d3bd-47a6-b1c2-943b8e9d4037","timestamp":"2026-02-03T00:28:12.108Z
