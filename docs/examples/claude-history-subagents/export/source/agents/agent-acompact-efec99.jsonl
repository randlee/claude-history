In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n                       If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.\n\nHere's an example of how your output should be structured:\n\n<example>\n<analysis>\n[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

User asked about export fix location and if it would be included in PR\n   - I confirmed the fix was done on develop branch (commit eeec094)\n   - Would be included since branching from develop\n\n2. User provided feedback on HTML quality: \"this still looks fairly primitive. I showed you html pages that I wanted copied, this looks nothing like what I gave you for demo\"\n\n3. I asked for clarification about what was wrong\n\n4. User showed a screenshot of the HTML output - mostly empty space with collapsed SUMMARY blocks and no actual content visible\n\n5. User identified issues:\n   - Width of viewable area should be much wider\n   - User/assistant bubbles should be right/left aligned\n   - Some text boxes have nice formatting but too much whitespace (double/triple line endings)\n   - Subagent and tool calls should be expandable with caret (collapsed by default)\n\n6. User added: \"the colors were certainly not picked out by a UX designer. Looks like they were picked by someone that was color blind\"\n\n7. I created 6 tasks to track the issues\n\n8. User asked to create sc-git-worktree and deploy background agents to fix issues\n\n9. I:\n   - Stashed changes on develop\n   - Created worktree: feature/phase10-html-quality\n   - Deployed 3 background agents in parallel to fix all 6 issues\n\n10. All 3 agents completed successfully with commits:\n    - 1195116: Skip empty messages + bubble alignment\n    - 4687d73: Width increase + text spacing\n    - c8017b3: Collapse/expand + colors\n\n11. QA agent found 1 failing test: TestHTMLOutput_ValidStructure\n\n12. Fix agent resolved the test failure (tool-call div had additional CSS classes)\n\n13. All tests passed, pushed branch, created PR #31\n\n14. User asked to see HTML with subagents for review\n\n15. I generated HTML export from current session (c04f363a with 85 subagents)\n\n16. User asked if newly generated - I confirmed yes\n\n17. User reported: \"there are no chevrons\"\n\n18. I checked the generated HTML and found the collapse/expand functionality wasn't working as expected - the chevrons that should appear next to subagent and tool call headers were missing from the output.\n\n19. Upon investigation, I discovered the chevrons were actually present in the HTML (271 total) but lacked color styling, so I added color, font-size, and opacity properties. After rebuilding and regenerating, I committed and pushed the fix (394631e).\n\n20. User reported still seeing no chevrons and mentioned copy buttons/icons had disappeared as well. I verified both elements exist in the HTML source - 271 chevrons and 331 copy buttons are definitely there.\n\n21. The CSS file loads correctly (72KB) with proper chevron styling, but the user can't see either element in their browser. This points to a CSS loading issue when opening the file locally.\n\n22. I suggested checking for \"[Read]\" text markers to locate where chevrons should appear and reviewing the browser console for any CSS loading errors.\n\n23. The next step is to test with a Python HTTP server instead of the file:// protocol, which should properly serve the CSS and resolve the visibility issue.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":148890,"cache_read_input_tokens":19739,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":148890,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmfY8CA3v5rHDnCNd6oN","type":"assistant","uuid":"d560b3d6-ee

Errors and fixes:\n   - **Error: TestHTMLOutput_ValidStructure test failing**\n     - Root cause: Test expected `<div class=\"tool-call\"` with closing quote, but HTML now has additional classes `collapsible collapsed`\n     - Fix: Changed test expectation to `<div class=\"tool-call` without closing quote to match additional CSS classes\n     - Commit: test fix commit\n   \n   - **Error: Chevrons not visible in generated HTML**\n     - Root cause: Chevrons had no color styling defined in CSS, making them invisible\n     - Fix: Added explicit color, font-size, and opacity to `.chevron` class\n     - Commit: 394631e\n   \n   - **Ongoing Error: User still cannot see chevrons or copy buttons despite being in HTML**\n     - Verified: 271 chevrons and 331 copy buttons exist in HTML source\n     - Verified: CSS file exists (72KB) and contains chevron styling\n     - Verified: HTML links to CSS with `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"static/style.css\">`\n     - Suspected cause: CSS not loading due to file:// protocol relative path issues\n     - Proposed fix: Use HTTP server (python -m http.server) instead of direct file:// protocol\n     - User feedback: \"I see no chevrons. It also looks like the copy buttons/icons have been removed.\"\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **Solved:** All 6 HTML quality issues implemented by parallel background agents\n   - **Solved:** Test suite passing after fixing TestHTMLOutput_ValidStructure\n   - **Solved:** PR #31 created successfully with all changes\n   - **Ongoing:** Debugging why chevrons and copy buttons don't render in browser despite being present in HTML source. Current hypothesis is CSS loading failure with file:// protocol. Recommended checking browser DevTools console and using HTTP server.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"also where was the fix to the `export` function done? will that be included in this PR?\"\n   - \"this is newly generated?\"\n   - \"there are no chevrons\"\n   - \"I see no chevrons. It also looks like the copy buttons/icons have been removed. Is there text I can search for in the html page to locate a chevron?\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Resolve CSS loading issue preventing chevrons and copy buttons from displaying in browser\n   - Verify HTML export displays correctly with all visual improvements\n\n8. Current Work:\n   User requested HTML export with subagents for review. Generated export from session c04f363a with 85 subagents at `/tmp/phase10-review.html/index.html`. User reported they cannot see chevrons or copy buttons despite both being present in the HTML source (verified 271 chevrons and 331 copy buttons). Investigated and found CSS file exists with correct styling. Suspected CSS not loading due to file:// protocol issues with relative paths. Suggested user check browser DevTools console for CSS loading errors and try opening via HTTP server instead.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Wait for user to check if CSS is loading in DevTools, or help them start an HTTP server to properly view the HTML with all styles applied. The user's last message asked: \"Is there text I can search for in the html page to locate a chevron?\" - I suggested searching for \"[Read]\" text to find tool headers where chevrons should appear, and provided instructions to check DevTools and try HTTP server approach.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":148890,"cache_read_input_tokens":19739,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":148890,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmfY8CA3v5rHDnCNd6oN","type":"assistant","uuid":"87a7df95-7ef0-4d64-967d-6fbaec0b4cb4","timestamp":"2026-02-03T19:12:29.260Z"}
