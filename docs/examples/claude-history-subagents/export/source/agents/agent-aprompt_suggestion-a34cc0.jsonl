The user has been directing me to use the skill properly and follow its guidance\n2. They questioned whether I created a PR\n3. I just explained that the merge was already pushed directly, bypassing the PR workflow\n4. I asked them which they prefer - revert and create a PR, or keep the current state\n\nThe user's pattern has been:\n- Very focused on doing things correctly\n- Insisted I use the skill and follow its documented behavior\n- Asked pointed questions about verification (branches still exist? tracking updated? PR created?)\n- When I took shortcuts, they called me out\n\nGiven this pattern and the fact that:\n- They just asked \"did you create a pr?\" (suggesting concern that proper workflow wasn't followed)\n- I acknowledged I didn't and asked what they prefer\n- The suggestion about the warning about PR requirement\n\nThey would likely want to follow proper git flow. They're the type who cares about process.\n\nMost likely next command: They'd ask me to revert and do it the right way with a PR. Or they might just say \"create a pr\" or \"revert and create a pr\".\n\nActually, looking at their style - they're direct. They'd probably just say one of:\n- \"create the pr\"\n- \"revert and create a pr\"  \n- \"create a pr for the merge\"\n- \"do it right - create a pr\"\n\nOr they might say \"keep it\" if they're fine with what happened.\n\nBut given their emphasis on doing things correctly and using the skill properly, and that there was literally a warning about PR requirements, I think they'd say something like:\n\n\"revert and create a pr\"\nor\n\"create a pr for the merge\"\nor just\n\"create the pr\"\n\nI'll go with the most direct version that matches their style.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":981,"cache_read_input_tokens":140750,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":981,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkapnfoAmBwS9XMm8Q2j","type":"assistant","uuid":"7f9a5449-8aec-4cf7-841b-7df24c237a8a","timestamp":"2026-02-03T05:28:57.270Z"}
