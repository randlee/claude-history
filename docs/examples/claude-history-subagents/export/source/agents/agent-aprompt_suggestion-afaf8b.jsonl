I clarified that Phase 10 branches are deleted, only Phases 4-8 remain\n\nThe natural next step from the user's perspective:\n- Phase 10 is complete and cleaned up\n- All PRs are merged to develop\n- The project is ready for release\n- They originally asked about \"next steps for release\" which were:\n  1. Merge develop → main\n  2. Tag release v0.10.0\n  3. Update changelog\n\nThe user would likely want to proceed with the release process. The most natural thing they'd type next is something like:\n- \"merge develop to main\" \n- \"prepare for release\"\n- \"tag the release\"\n- \"git checkout main and merge develop\"\n\nLooking at their style, they're direct and action-oriented. They'd probably say something like:\n\"merge develop to main\"\nor\n\"proceed with release\"\nor just\n\"merge develop into main\"\n\nLet me keep it concise and match their terse style.","signature":"Ev0JCkYICxgCKkBMsaQgAot/K7jL6F38yuU/kDgdBWnTu8c+DBIceJ5DeyyXv6sN21nj6AEdhyrV1IQ9uQDONnYn20aXxXiLng/FEgzVGOWJQ5OQWSKm1bEaDP+u6bnx3iLTyn9/DyIwSz1jsUpPp5hmhqV0yIYcRnxyQ2ozzwfwb0UL91qeh7ap78V2trXNbeFKv56m9uJNKuQICkOruLJfVsK20kj79KzjpRrKRVZC8uo4ZhaFS+1b7p0SP5kvRjjS62O/RbP99+bxXJvBC8k5qN0z2ClbK5XXpNDR7RIysVHhlhPndzaScOhGbTuIvWQEsdRHAIzHj93kXuji1vm5p0ojVZYLFC9lVdzSIrVNu1Gtb9u6mT7BvvjV/QY3mLjaa+/LRG9I4+KkgvcbnWGEdP+9XlrEDfAkaGY0+lu1aigFG3L4l6UFxXvsoOQFlqyIEVRpMvyMnrS42iFqP7ozAoCb+tKDUq5l6Qg4c0MoSN8Jqc8M/UL1zVBnzV0qloWr2bAxBbkKvpjivLIDrc7InXHqmurMD0h/ODtsmaEigPjKiv9M0ol+3lSvoG0mDCR9+1WYvEV5n9qyoKZlmENyw4FPS7unW7W3PlqTFbilesXyONDE0lKGdFHZiphWc2f0EgCRNoTvreuX8lCY55ruqAMEtw3yu/LarELw38YeRgb5F/Ga+jwpLCO04tg9nXBumf4OR4dTgjuGGwOzs6T377ZdXqb+8po+I2r6pgu1ioDXMKHw3EZSStp4wUMdiSwJAm+B6dNPxdxYA9w6e7imQ9n1euRCOFMOQhNfOJ5Uio2o8Ti20BIJsfXYyTC14KcIBWE9lNqOBJnFPIUObNOEAjY6YvE0yJentKqOyfzyq+RBZQggrG0HI2trrTHoJarMQZ0pHG/tdyz62qXlnBIe3spYrEnQ2My6Nh+QeaGEYzsYstL8aqhpcFEW46+DXIh8lcnpIDAK+CLPlBFFtNJ64tJBmMh3SqOB7F+UTk4fgC8kXIMh/v/6f+PjJ+O1w6wxwkzwp0/mDn81f/4CZwhY4DAhfGs66KTrLE+D25NicYDx51/pse8dIFf0ttF0Oc/ZMJM7Pqq/cUTCAM4o5pWX/VgTYYSrGu9f5MmFu6vw7S1BA7RWJHyJo1jtHgnjb6O94lBwwjYv4+vwOf5Ql7avFkgTFqEkDRA4zTTXMS0q3smjP02YgKZp5fbA+5fEZt41qXqh6fS6iNA9qTzL0Skr2BW9XyZkQ9TfDd3NoPnhkbd3HZzneNmpFIDMs8bsxrLhsTHMQugX8kLO73yFdizAN69wH5gM77xap3lyedWJlCrA1h0Ei/+VzLu7FgoYtkyvqPQEmgdw0Hum1W6HD7ZaO/ibK+Dt7ywhfndUksHQQrqkyf9WsV0KnwzFLs0L2hdYNhOpWbHJ/UUpAUSA48b76huZh4lxZXMSMkn07hrL0kjsmpJrZa6Oz4dwEbBlJKcsE0Ock6VLYPjUnLj+25nO5nUhCgNyuB5KmklPNLTifDEDBYH9hDtMMS2SuJUj49wnzGpFd4pRS5f0eLshuBYEWwmEeazjO7Gd8OYXORNKuRjqs8DbcwASEQ+h37BXlOlq06hweDvhmjvCNlZ/C4mTRoexUlzlxqJe42dRI8zzlPkiKEM6NgO+4eC2BQcrx8ftt1IXMXVeWQhdPNy3KTW0N0dhIryHsgBCkyFtKksYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":931,"cache_read_input_tokens":123192,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":931,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkLsnpBW61Pip33Uv4Ys","type":"assistant","uuid":"a8e1388a-94e4-48d2-95d5-42a71698764d","timestamp":"2026-02-03T02:26:00.802Z"}
