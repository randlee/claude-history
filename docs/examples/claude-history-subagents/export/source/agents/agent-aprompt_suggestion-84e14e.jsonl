I asked if they want to proceed with Sprint 10i or wait for PRs to merge.\n\nLooking at the user's pattern in this session:\n- \"go\" - to start Wave 2\n- \"pr completed, update project-plan with progress this session\" - after PRs merged\n- \"deploy background agents for next sprint\" - to start Wave 3\n\nThe user seems to want to keep momentum going. They might say:\n- \"wait for PRs to merge\" or \"merge them first\"\n- \"proceed with 10i\" or \"deploy 10i\"\n- \"merge and continue\"\n\nGiven their pattern of wanting to keep things moving, they'd likely want to merge first and then continue. But they also asked about merging previously indirectly.\n\nActually, looking at their style - short commands like \"go\" and direct instructions - they'd probably say something like:\n\n\"merge and deploy 10i\" or \"proceed with 10i\" or just \"merge them\"\n\nSince the PRs need to pass CI first typically, they might just say \"merge\" or wait for CI to pass.
