Enable admin enforcement (which requires web UI, so they'd do that independently)\n2. Check on the CI status of PR #30\n3. Ask me to do something else\n\nGiven that:\n- They just saw instructions to manually enable admin enforcement\n- PR #30 is running and will take some time\n- The natural thing would be to check on progress while they handle the manual setup\n\nThey'd likely ask: \"check the ci status\" or \"what's the status on pr 30\" or similar\n\nOr they might just go enable admin enforcement first, then come back.\n\nActually, the most natural thing after I said \"you need to enable it manually\" would be for them to either:\n1. Go do it (offline)\n2. Ask me to check on CI while they do that\n\nMost likely: \"check pr 30 status\" or \"check ci progress\" or something similar - monitoring what's happening while they handle the GitHub web UI task.\n\nActually, re-reading - they might just go enable it and then come back. But if they're asking me questions, they'd probably ask me to check status.\n\nLet me think about what's most natural after my last message...\n\nI said: \"Once you do that, the security gap will be closed and you'll have proper protection.\"\n\nThe natural response would be to either:\n1.
