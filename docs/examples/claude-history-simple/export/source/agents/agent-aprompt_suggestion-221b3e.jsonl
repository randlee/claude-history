User asked about fixing CI failures on PR 18\n2. We did a design review and discovered data model issues\n3. Created a detailed Phase 9 plan in PROJECT_PLAN.md\n4. CI passed, Phase 7 & 8 are actually complete\n5. I offered three options: update PROJECT_PLAN, clean up worktrees, or start Phase 9\n\nThe user seems focused on getting things wrapped up and moving forward. They pulled develop, checked status, and asked \"what is left w/ phase 7/8 work?\" - they want to understand completion status and likely want to close things out.\n\nGiven that Phase 7/8 are done, the natural next steps would be:\n1. Clean up the worktrees (6 stale ones)\n2. Merge the PRs\n3. Mark things complete in PROJECT_PLAN\n\nThe user's style is direct and brief. They would likely want to clean things up before starting new work. \"Clean up the worktrees\" or \"update the plan and clean up worktrees\" seems like what they'd want.\n\nActually, looking at the options I gave, the user might just say something like:\n- \"yes, do all of that\" \n- \"1 and 2\" (update plan and clean up)\n- \"clean up the worktrees\"\n- \"update the plan, clean up worktrees, then we can discuss phase 9\"\n\nGiven their brief style: \"update the plan and clean up worktrees\" or just \"1 and 2\"","signature":"EoULCkYICxgCKkAnp9XQR5xif2xyBshPPSc0aQfjRzr2TvBcWNW6A5c2TX2lUUDmQamfEdvbj+CcVRt/h1LcOThzOPA/TdhVHuLXEgygdkPlbIL7dBUY/MAaDLDSrn2ikzpKT8d5zyIwr/cqr6+Y2aP+e4jPjIo3V80t0M1vdx6UYME+be1Zop5g1cUPP1WTiAhY4L0zRlv7KuwJqxbK0DvJKffK2Uu+joOl9PRYznrQyS3BZs3cSsXdUZZjqlgOBRCuYw65jrm6S9iOyvEM0pvp7nv8GZc987YPCmRSF+JmL+/J7EJtiZxqH+HIvnnrSt564wAINxZZ6V9XRzxWG+6XO0fkymuWisAdsQ4nN/wTLrCpEa9lm4Y1yWzxUpAP19B9TRXcB+BLyUZeJki8m7pji9o6H9GaNupnxeGJb6JojLX9ShFE1DEUw2Rycj010iYIroZ2jmx+YC3G3/08kU4y3Ge8jsh2vnMUU9U+Z72eWi5oDIOvYt3lK01lOqZAXaKcd630snOFmz6dKTp7gpbIzNYuDpHiZeEVVHS2J302bGyysbyGMdTYdBZbU4CAAx1RFOuKex6dXLvWX0gqy3IR7xkR9S+J2lqlFRt80Jmx2mwJ0FydRLWTJ8j+IfzL3YQ7ysozPnoJm9qr2+ekDyV1/oJ3a8EJIe+POT+CBP6edfLf/yeNelaFmoOrwFm0UmO9B8+Yk/R7icetGrZF6Wd4dgY6Vox/dlnWgM50/muGlWELYB8b0ypwZr2/tbP9k6v4l5bZtuZ8p+R0jyzZ35rBXOIFRyQ2NUrkgpr7ALVrUOJ7acllM4FlohzVQFe3ca8xXk58YWX7zwzfAP+G+bzG8+JjRfUJ/rkMh1vSLE8Fqq1SrSGWXo9XSw5IaOWIur92437bcCsqcSlZbfslVjTgVNzMMN0R3TEs8AKUvyQIjVrAt1YKHIUdYedShac9Ml4nLPePFKhsjiYl6Mg7X/KJmuHuL85VCvyrwhmBHMNZgEGrrbkvyyzE8PJTjUCf2qPRO0EStUD9PJhUlqV+UfIBhK57ofVcmzAAIwZ1XmTOfkFzZKg/uHXPA7XFn67BnODy3atiFeCZ7gomvgepsEJyJDjLf6uqSoXQzqm9n6Lp07pt0LSC5VHy2cchi/p27wGm3l8dWuba17AeFF2kJTv39ovOMi8HnPI+BJ0xa7r6e1pFh7y7y5wghNfZTrkaAnz9BSGCza1KeoyDpKRYbfpbWlTgbNxFpxONtFG3v2mtUVtPbFaefB1gn18atHvfbRg2XH6C6GCYwpYh6I8unvhpVKYqQR3vPU22+30wxK81OZaZAxKAGY6wb0FFxZkNMl4GCK5okPUD9yQuBLcK02HOx9N1pU98L4E8Ol9kSVvInPCANVWI8csC/lk60RFqnSMW6RcBFp93Bfxjz5aU2shFPhPTp2YvCl0VfjfCrtSKEuoV2mCtBPet9qT+Ct58eBHzKxR0QIN7vgedyGV6bMEUJPWxFfgqlrY8hGC1TNeaQOXYpbdZatCwNHGqXTFdkWONv8MxNU1xg41f8n7QieXZrSVKW/sxZPJNtrBNnT3dRAVhjpIMExsFrbQPZkdvlNHIRfcgj8VkoFv83hq1s4YDD39SNyLFTNci/djmWgxuNcCaIRSzmkUXjYm0kaZg3pBZXJab5eo6ulADbu5s+IaZRJliKawprgBEfTQnDRE1aNG4KI/MRhkuHH/0ABL/qWZet2IOqn860G+fEaf5MLNyggklU69O2hOEjUZBldZNEHwhMB/4lKwyeSZvz5hE7BX2IJpuMLEw3q+cW2repxHk07F6FF4IXcUPChmPU1YFLlhbGqW224nBdJ+EVAv+3Foic0tXlvNJ4a4KqG+dd9zFp3ILo16eGAE="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":113095,"cache_read_input_tokens":19761,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":113095,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXig5yiJwHyoPN3MNsPuC","type":"assistant","uuid":"4e5e75b0-a8b8-4de4-9fdd-a8998748564c","timestamp":"2026-02-02T05:16:49.099Z"}
