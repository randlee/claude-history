User asked to fix CI test failing, do design review, then fix\n2. I merged develop, fixed go.mod, fixed lint errors\n3. I did a critical design review and discovered a major data model mismatch\n4. User asked me to create a detailed plan and add it to PROJECT_PLAN.md\n5. I did that, CI is now passing, and I asked what they want to prioritize next:\n   - Merge PR #18 to develop?\n   - Start Phase 9 implementation?\n   - Continue Phase 7/8 work first?\n\nThe user has been very engaged in this technical discussion. They asked for the design review and then wanted a plan documented. The logical next step based on their engagement would be to either:\n- Merge PR #18 (since CI is passing and it was the immediate task)\n- Start on Phase 9 (since it's critical and they just reviewed it)\n\nGiven their focus on fixing the root cause issue and that they specifically asked about the nested agent design issue, they'd likely want to start fixing it now that the plan is documented and PR #18 is ready.\n\nThe most natural next step would be to merge PR #18 first (clean up the immediate work), then start Phase 9.\n\nBased on the user's style (concise, action-oriented), they might say something like:\n- \"merge pr 18 and start phase 9\"\n- \"merge 18, then start on 9a\"\n- \"let's merge and start phase 9\"\n\nI'll suggest something that matches their direct style.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":108060,"cache_read_input_tokens":19761,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":108060,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXifuVUQL1k7UpxJQoDJj","type":"assistant","uuid":"e3f481c0-ffc7-4bdf-9afd-01b5e5dec6d7","timestamp":"2026-02-02T05:14:28.347Z"}
